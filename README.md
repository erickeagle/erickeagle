## Data is present all around us, the main purpose is how to use that data in the right way.

I am a pre-final year B.Tech Student. I am well versed with some of the important libraries such as sci-kit learn, Keras, pandas, etc. and implemented the machine learning the algorithm on datasets available on the internet which includes MNIST dataset, on which I used the classification algorithm to identify handwritten digits. Similarly, I applied sentimental analysis on the IMDB dataset, carried out facial recognition using OpenCV and KNN, predicted movie reviews using LSTM, classified pokemon from a pokemon dataset using CNN and transfer learning and other similar problems. I have worked on building GUI using the PyQt module and know about implementing a database with a good grasp of data structures with moderate coding skills. I am quick at grasping new concepts and their implementation.
